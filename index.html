I am an MS in Computer Science student at New York University currently doing research under the advisement of <a href="https://hhexiy.github.io/">Professor He He</a>. Previously, I was an NLP Research Intern at <a href="https://www.merlinlabs.com/">Merlin Labs</a>, working on Semantic Parsing in Task-Oriented Dialogues. I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in May 2021 with a BS in Computer Science.
